title: Finally, done with school
---

Well I finally finished my degree. It took a little longer, than I had initially planned, but that doesn't matter one bit. 

While it hasn't always been fun, it was an amazing experience all around and I wouldn't change it for anything. 

So what's the plan now? Well, I've been toying around with the idea of doing some freelance analytic work. Now that I have the time, I can go ahead and work on my own special projects. Any requests?
