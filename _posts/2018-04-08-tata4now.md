title: The last one for a while!

I know I just started and thankfully, I think I might have gotten the hang of not just what GitHub is, but also how to use it. Even if it is within a fairly remedial capacity. 

Unfortunately, circumstances as they are right now, don't afford me the time necessary to post to this blog or upload any code to GitHub page. That'll change, later this year, once things settle down in my life and I can afford sometime to developing a new normal consisting of:

1. Learning French
2. More data analysis
3. CrossFit!!
